Quest #43: 8. Myrrdan is framed for a terrorist attack on a Bar-zhon world by independent faction of Thrynn and Coalition forces.  Source of this tip is Bar-zhon miners who reveal that the Bar-zhon are planning to retaliate. Thrynn and Coalition denies any knowledge of the event. Bar-zhon ships during this quest refuse to communicate and attack the player.

The Elowan direct the player to a meeting location, Wledig 2026 (120S X 14E) in the Fodla system (109, 55) where Thrynn and Coalition troops were seen gathering.

Thrynn base located but no evidence of any Coalition presence. Red Herring artifact. When Red Herring is taken back to the Elowan, they reveal a second meeting place.

Bor Tuatheh 2019 (32N X 57E) in the Aircthech system (100, 8) The second meeting place shows evidence of a large number of Coalition and Thrynn ships landing, and remains of a fabrication factory to produce Myrrdan style hull plating is found.

Player told to take holographic evidence to the Bar-zhon immediately.  Bar-zhon communication must answer three sets of questions correctly or be attacked. If answered correctly the Bar-zhon take the holographic evidence, provide a government communiqué to take back to Myrrdan, and inform the player that the retaliation fleet was already destroyed en-route to Myrrdan by a surprise ambush of Tafel and infected ships working together.

-Minex ancients: "The In'tral'ess or Ancients gifted us or enhanced us with the mental powers to fight the Uyo.  Much knowledge over the ages has been lost.  Either the Uyo genetically damaged us or the eternal ones may have withdrawn their gifts.  Without them, we are shattered and crippled."

-Minex ancients: "The ancients or the eternal ones are energy beings.  They have left this space-time continuum.  We feel that one of their centers was on the outer planet of a yellow star, but remember not where."

-Elowan ancients: "We had ascertained that a city of the ancients existed in our home sector, within a system inside the rim of starforming nebulae, almost exactly 100 parsecs upspin from the war-torn Veloxi homeworld.  Landing coordinates in empire terminology were 15N X 6E.  How thou couldst make use of this knowledge is not known since that realm is nay inaccessible."

The inert device allows those who are physically touching it to receive telepathic impressions from other ancient devices.  When brought near the Ancient Database Plates researchers feel the sensation of indistinct memories of events.  Correlations between records have allowed us to 'read' the database plates in a matter of fashion. The pertinent data is the discovery of 'focal points' in ancient society.  We have learned details of an interdimensional ancient device known as a crystal sphere.  The Minex describe these focal points as vast assemblies of ruins filled with endurium, often containing samples of advanced technology.  A high-energy device such as a pearl-sized crystal sphere could boost their telepathic abilities to the level where it would be possible for them to contact the ancients.  Your mission is to locate a city of the ancients in the hope that a crystal sphere may be recovered.  As Ancient artifact sites on one world are often parallel on others, we recommend starting with stories of historic finds such as the ones that the Elowan spoke of.",

You are the UYO. We are ancients. We will be leaving. We gather the seeds.  The mysterious ships start disappearing slowly one at a time.  We thank you. We remove ourselves. We comprehend infection.
