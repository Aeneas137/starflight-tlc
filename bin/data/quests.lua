Over a dozen Coalition ships have converged on the world from different locations and have been endlessly scanning the surface for weeks now.  Inquiries to their activities have been met with denials.  We covertly intercepted and decoded communications that have revealed little other than repeated references to Alta-hlai. In the historic record, Alta-hlai was a famous Bar-zhon explorer who charted distant areas of space in the dead zone coreward of Spemin territory on his final expedition.  The Great War flared up just before his return, and he transmitted a report of finding a powerful weapon that disrupted life-force. Unfortunately his ship vanished shortly afterwards and was presumed lost due to the hostilities.  Without revealing our intelligence sources, your assignment is to discretely contact the other alien races concerning Coalition activity and to inquire concerning additional historic information about Alta-hlai.  If Alta-hlai's disruptor is found, it may of course prove to be a devastating weapon but it also theoretically might be used to disrupt the nanomachine's control of the infected.",

Quest #68: 9.	Elowan warn of military buildup to raze Myrrdan. The Elowan are too weak to oppose the action on their own.  They have tried to contact the Thrynn on our behalf but have been ignored. The Bar-zhon won't intervene, fail to honor the Myrrdan alliance, but promise to send strong diplomatic condemnation, the Nyssian confirm the fleet location (give the player a data rod) and report that the fleet is no longer at their home world but is hiding well outside of the ecliptic of the system but have no fleet of their own to assist us with.  The Minex refuse to act in judiciary role.  They report that any military assistance of any type always turns aggression upon themselves in the long term. Your assistance has been invaluable but your survival is irrelevant if you can't defend yourselves. To resolve this mission, the player must contact the Spemin, pretend to be Uyo, give system and location (Nyssian data rod). They tell you to wait and contact them again later. They report that a large fleet of infected ships have wiped out the taskforce and provide a Spemin data crystal for the player to give to starport.

Large fleets of pirates and infected have been assailing all races including ourselves, but since we only have a single star systems to defend, our dedicated military and strong system defenses have allowed us to withstand attack after attack. Unfortunately we now have a major event our hands.  The Thrynn have completely withdrawn from the alliance, withdrawn all of their ships from the joint defensive fleet in the sector, and have been massing warships in their home system. The Elowan have secretly informed us that the Thrynn government has started whipping up their population against humans as the Uyo, blaming us for all of their problems, and are preparing to send most of their ships to Myrrdan to raze our homeworld.

The Elowan independently tracked the signal to a minstrel who flees after relaying the message. Elowan pass on the following message and tell the player the background history of the minstrels:

Fury born without focus
Ancient evil without a core
An alliance born from willful blindness
Tethers history and ancient lore.

The crystal ones right is not to fight.
As salvation's winds blindly turn their way.
Distant reforms may echo true,
To close the past, the mute must play

When brought near your earlier discovery, the Ancient Database Plates, researchers temporarily feel the sensation of vague, indistinct memories of events overlaid within their own personal memories. Dozens of researchers using the device have recorded their impressions and correlations between records have allowed us to 'read' the database plates in a matter of fashion. The most pertinent data from the device reveal the location of focal points of ancient society. We also have learned details of an interdimensional ancient device known as a crystal sphere.  The Minex have been able to provide further information and they describe these focal points as vast assemblies of ruins filled with endurium, often containing samples of advanced technology.  If a high-energy device such as a pearl-sized crystal sphere is found, they believe it is capable of boosting their telepathic abilities a level where it would be possible for them to contact the ancients directly.  Your mission is to locate a city of the ancients in the hope that a crystal sphere can be recovered.
