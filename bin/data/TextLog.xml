    <Text>The Kelvyn Co. Research Outpost on Islay recently relayed a request for a number of Basic Robots and Automatons which are capable of doing laborious and custodial tasks within the confines of the facility. Of course, the Kelvyn Co. will reimburse the captain who delivers the cargo.</Text>

    <Text>Kelvyn Co. has found a massive concentration of Titanium on the planet of Islay and need someone to deliver samples of the rich new find to Metneb Factory on Planet Ciuin in the Faidh system. This could result in a potentially beneficial partnership between the two corporations and the rewards for the willing captain would certainly be satisfactory.</Text>
