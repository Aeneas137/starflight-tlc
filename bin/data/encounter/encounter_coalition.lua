	ENCOUNTER SCRIPT FILE: COALITION

	Last Modified:  December 23, 2009

	Globals shared with C++ module:
		ACTION - actions invoked by script (see below)
		POSTURE - obsequious, friendly, hostile
		ATTITUDE - this alien's attitude toward player (1 to 100)
		GREETING - greeting text after calling Greeting()
		STATEMENT - statement text after calling Statement()
		QUESTION - question text after calling Question()
		RESPONSE - alien's responses to all player messages
		QUESTION1..5 - choices available in a branch actiona
		Q{} - same choices but in table format
		GOTO1..5 - jump locations associated with branch choices
		G{} - same gotos but in table format

	ACTION REFERENCE:
		restart = start dialogue over at beginning
		terminate = end communication
		attack = engage in combat

	C++ module should examine all globals after any function is called.

--[[ What do you think of this idea: I've dumped all the statements from the Coalition initial file,
	 plus a few from other files (most are the same) into this categorized statements table (could
	 do same for greetings). Using this (see below) would have one big advantage: if the statements
	 are categorized well, so that the same set of alien responses will suffice for each category,
	 we can make the player field a *table* (just like the alien response), thus greatly multiplying
	 the range of communications statement/response combinatoric possibilities. It also would allow
	 further dumping of additional statements and greetings into the categories to be propagated to
	 all scripts with essentially no effort at all (and extending communications variability yet
	 further). All the dialogue is also centralized into 1 spot for easy maintenance, saving a bit
	 on editing time.

	 The disadvantage is that then you no longer have the exact text you're replying to directly
	 above your reply, and would need to refer to the common file (where these would wind up).
	 There are not so many of many statements & greetings that this would be a big issue.

	 I put a few examples of using this into the friendly statements section; I've tested this &
	 it works OK. - ww
