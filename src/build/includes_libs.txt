STARFLIGHT : THE LOST COLONY

The include and lib folders here contain all of the header and lib files referenced
by the project in a single location, so there is no need to install Allegro, AllegroGL,
or FMOD separately, with all the required files contained here.

You will need to add an Include and Library reference to these folders in Visual C++
(look in Tools -> Options -> Projects and Solutions - > VC++ Directories).
